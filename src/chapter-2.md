Interactive experiences are becoming increasingly important for museum visitors. These experiences allow visitors to engage with exhibits in new and exciting ways, enhancing their understanding and appreciation of the subject matter.

Interactive experiences can take many forms, from hands-on activities and multimedia displays to virtual reality and augmented reality exhibits. By providing interactive experiences, museums can:
